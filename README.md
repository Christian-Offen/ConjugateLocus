# ConjugateLocus

Run ./variational/Locus3D_Cusps.ipynb to compute the two closed lines of cusps in the bifurcation diagram as well as the location of the four umbilic singularities.

Run ./variational/ComputeDataIsoSurf_FullLocus.ipynb and then ./variational/Isosurface.m to compute preimages of the sheets of folds of the bifurcation diagram. Run ./variational/MapIsoDataLocus.py to compute data of the conjugate locus and ./variational/LocusIsosurface.m to compute plots of these.

All plots and figures are written to the folder ./variational/Plots.
